# EndoMAP
EndoMAP aims to systematically dissect the human endosomal protein complexes.

Scripts used for the generation and analysis of EndoMAP:
- Endosomal proteome meta-analysis
- Co-fractionation: to derive protein-protein interaction level data from protein complex information based on correlation profiling
- EndoMAP protein network generation and analysis
- Co-localization analysis: for data visualization and statistical analysis of microscopy data
